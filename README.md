Elemental
=========

Quickly audit every element on a page.

Elemental first renders a page, then proceeds to split it into roughly equal-sized elements.  A screenshot of each element, its underlying HTML, and computed styles are then recorded into a database.  Finally, these images are loaded and arranged by visual similarity.
